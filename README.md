##fetchAPI exercise! :D

Small project for practicing fetchAPI concepts. 
I had to face some trouble since the original API that i was supposed to use wasn't working anymore, 
so i found another one similar to it and made the neccessary changes in order to make it work properly 

#DOM Manipulation
I manipulate the DOM through JS, this project was great to practice my understanding of the events and how i can add or edit elements directly with JS into the HTML :D. Also doing this in combination with fetchAPI was really nice too, since i was able to add stuff to the html by generating an html element structure with the data requested with JS and passing it through the innerHTML property.
